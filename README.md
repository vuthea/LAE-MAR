# LAE-MAR
Live actor and entity (LAE) refers to a representation of a living physical object such as human being who portrays a character in a performance that can move and interact with virtual objects in the virtual reality. Since head-mounted display devices are used for viewing 360o virtual reality, the embedding method needs to be adapted to the 360o environment. Therefore, we propose the cylindrical embedding method and a system design for a LAE to be represented into 360o virtual reality scene. The system design describes how a LAE in the physical world can be captured, tracked, recognized, and mapped into the 360o environment. Additionally, we introduce the components of LAE representation system and the proposed HTML5 nodes with the detail of input and output information. The implementation is based on web system by providing features of the cross-platform on the web browser and lightweight programming. As the result, the implementation of LAE representation system can be used to map the LAE in the physical world with Chromakeying or non-Chromakeying according to LAEâ€™s characteristics into 360o virtual reality. And, the event handling can control the objects in 360o virtual reality scene such as camera control, objects control, and natural movement of the LAE.
